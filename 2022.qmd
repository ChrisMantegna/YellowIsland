This cohort tested methods, content, and the beta version of the program while producing some of the most beautiful art and communication media.

Intertidal monitoring hadn't been done on the island except for two separate Friday harbor Labs student projects in 1980 and 2004. This group took the old methods, updated to suit our needs and newest technology, and set out to recreate the 2004 species inventory while adding a quantitative component.

Below are the redefined sites for the 2022 survey.](images/oldstudy information.png)

The scholars created a Species ID guide, completed quadrat and transect surveys, got their boaters licenses, and created a poster that acts as a key for the public to prominent intertidal species.
