title: Mentorship
---

A primary aim of the program is to provide mentorship for students who hold marginalized identities while they learn the ecology and communication skills required for community- engaged work. Our program connects students with mentors who share a variety of marginalized identities as well as a variety of experiences that connect them to science. Our students, like our mentors, carry many skills not obviously linked to science so it is our job to make these networking connections.

Over the last tow sessions, students have engaged with more than 20 scientists in our "Meet A Scientist" speaker and skill- builder series. All student speakers were compensated for their time by BIMS.

Check back to see the work and biographies of our esteemed scientists and artists as we finish fine- tuning the content!
