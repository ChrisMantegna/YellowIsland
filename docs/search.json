    "section": "",
    "text": "The impacts of anthropogenic activities on natural environments are growing ever more complex and far-reaching. Moreover, the impacts can be more pervasive and yet go unnoticed in aquatic habitats like marine intertidal environments. Long-term monitoring programs provide an opportunity to examine the (changing) relationship between organisms and their habitats to better inform our understanding of the interplay between biotic and abiotic conditions. This is the second year of the Yellow Island Monitoring project and the first full season of data collection. \nThe Yellow Island project focus is on (1) understanding the island’s ecology using observation, molecular techniques, and the synthesis of multi-source data, and (2) understanding the interconnectedness of the Salish Sea ecosystem and the foundational changes induced by human activities and climate change. Students worked onsite at Yellow Island and in the lab at Friday harbor Labs collecting qualitative and quantitative data that can help us answer questions of intertidal community composition, food web dynamics, predator prey interactions, and physiological trade-offs in the face of a changing climate.\n\n\n\nYellow Island as seen on approach from the Friday Harbor side by boat.

    "text": "A primary aim of the program is to provide mentorship for students who hold marginalized identities while they learn the ecology and communication skills required for community- engaged work. Our program connects students with mentors who share a variety of marginalized identities as well as a variety of experiences that connect them to science. Our students, like our mentors, carry many skills not obviously linked to science so it is our job to make these networking connections.\nOver the last two sessions, students have engaged with more than 20 scientists in our “Meet A Scientist” speaker and skill- builder series. All student speakers were compensated for their time by BIMS.\nCheck back to see the work and biographies of our esteemed scientists and artists as we finish fine- tuning the content!\nChris Mantegna | Matt Axling | Tiara Moore, PhD | Camille Gaynus, PhD |\nProgram Mentor | Program Mentor | BIMS CEO | BIMS Chief Science Officer |\n\nMalik Johnson | Kristen Privitera - Johnson | Moronke Harris | Julietta Martinelli, PhD |\nNaturalist | Graduate Student | Graduate Student | Postdoc, UW SAFS |\n\nNatalie Baillargeon | Sarah Tanja | Andrea Pierce | | Jose Guzman, PhD |\nGraduate Student | Graduate Student | Scientific Artist | Professor, UW |\n\nEmily Jameson | Lys Isma | Carina Fish, PhD | Sophie George, PhD |\nGraduate Student | Graduate Student | Science Policy | UW FHL Research Scientist |\n\nLee Qi | | Mahogany Monet | Yaamini Venkataraman, PhD\nGraduate Student | Graduate Student | Postdoc, WHOI|"

The primary program sponsor (support) is Black In Marine Science (BIMS), helmed by CEO Dr. Tiara Moore and BIMS Chief Science Officer Dr. Camille Gaynus. The program partner is The Nature Conservancy (TNC) with on-site co-mentor and Yellow Island Land Steward Matt Axling.\nWorking together we identified a need for immediate and long- term data of the marine environment for TNC, the managers of Yellow Island. TNC would reciprocate by providing access to the island to scholars to learn ecological field methods safely and without interference. Yellow Island is an 11 acre island that will take personnel to support survey efforts. Partnering with the Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program and the Friday Harbor Labs REU program an 8- week program that can support providing a snapshot in time of health of the Salish Sea by meeting the following goals:\n\nEcology - Using observation, molecular techniques, and the synthesis of multi-source data \nConservation - Salish Sea ecosystem and the changes induced by human activities \nCommunity - Increasing environmental literacy skills in a safe field site while supporting community driven questions\n\n\nClick on the cohort year to see what they accomplished over their summer internship.\n\n\n\n2022 Cohort\n2023 Cohort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022 DDCSP Scholars with program mentors.
