## Locking in the methods

The 2023 Cohort was a combination of Doris Duke Conservation Scholars (Carly & Kamryn) and Friday Harbor Labs REU Scholars (Logan & Coira). Together they took over 500 quadrats of data and made guidebooks, videos, presentations and posters to communicate their work!

This group took the methods and ran with them! Combining art, ecology, and molecular tools we were able to identify more than 20 different phyla on the island, visualize them and create a family workbook to support families visiting the island. This cohort spent a total of 8 weeks learning Pacific Northwest intertidal organisms and the tools to assess their biodiversity, make hypotheses about their interactions, and begin to tease apart the complexities of aquatic eosystems.
